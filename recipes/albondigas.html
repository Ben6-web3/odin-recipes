        <h3>Ingredients</h3>  
          <ul>
              <li>1 quart water</li>
              <li>4 carrots, sliced</li>
              <li>2 small potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
              <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
              <li>1 1/2 cup salsa, medium or hot</li>
              <li>2 beef boullion cubes</li>
              <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
              <li>1/3 cup seasoned dry bread crumbs</li>
              <li>1/3 cup of milk</li>
              <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>  
          <ul>
              <li>In a large stock pot, bring water, carrots, potatoes, onion, salsa, and bouillon cubes to a boil. Reduce to a medium simmer, stirring occasionally, approximately 10 minutes.</li>
