TOP HTML Project
In this project I will put into practice the knowledge gained from my TOP HTML foundations course. 

The idea is to build a basic recipe website. Per instructions the website will consist of an index page which will then link to recipes. This will be a basic website which will be refined as I progress through the TOP curriculum.

The skills I look to display are:
1. Correct Elements and Tags usage
2. Creating an html Boilerplate
3. Working with text
4. Lists in html
5. Links and images
